# Tracing

Just like the way [agents are traced](../tracing.md), voice pipelines are also automatically traced.

You can read the tracing doc above for basic tracing information, but you can additionally configure tracing of a pipeline via [`VoicePipelineConfig`][cai.sdk.agents.voice.pipeline_config.VoicePipelineConfig].

Key tracing related fields are:

-   [`tracing_disabled`][cai.sdk.agents.voice.pipeline_config.VoicePipelineConfig.tracing_disabled]: controls whether tracing is disabled. By default, tracing is enabled.
-   [`trace_include_sensitive_data`][cai.sdk.agents.voice.pipeline_config.VoicePipelineConfig.trace_include_sensitive_data]: controls whether traces include potentially sensitive data, like audio transcripts. This is specifically for the voice pipeline, and not for anything that goes on inside your Workflow.
-   [`trace_include_sensitive_audio_data`][cai.sdk.agents.voice.pipeline_config.VoicePipelineConfig.trace_include_sensitive_audio_data]: controls whether traces include audio data.
-   [`workflow_name`][cai.sdk.agents.voice.pipeline_config.VoicePipelineConfig.workflow_name]: The name of the trace workflow.
-   [`group_id`][cai.sdk.agents.voice.pipeline_config.VoicePipelineConfig.group_id]: The `group_id` of the trace, which lets you link multiple traces.
-   [`trace_metadata`][cai.sdk.agents.voice.pipeline_config.VoicePipelineConfig.tracing_disabled]: Additional metadata to include with the trace.
